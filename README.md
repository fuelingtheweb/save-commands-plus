# save-commands-plus package for Atom editor

This package allows you to define parametrized shell commands
to be automatically run, in sequence, whenever a file matching glob pattern is saved.  
This effectively eliminates the need for file watchers, and simplifies your build process.  
You can define as many globs and commands as you want.
The command(s) and their output will be displayed in a dock at the bottom of the screen. Hit 'Esc' to dismiss the dock.  

*Note:* This package is a fork of the original "save-commands" package created by Jason Hunt (JsonHunt) that can be found [here](https://github.com/JsonHunt/save-commands).  
Updates have been made to make it more user friendly and work with Atom's new dock system.

### How to use

Create save-commands.json file in your project's root folder
Create one entry for each command you wish to run, and assign it to a glob like this:  
glob : command {parameter}

Here is an example of save-commands.json file
```
{
	"commands": [
		"*.coffee : coffee -c {relFullPath}",
		"src/**/*.coffee : coffee -c -o dist{relPathNoRoot} {relFullPath}",
		"src/**/client/**/*.coffee : gulp browserify",
		"src/client/**/*.jade   : jade -P {relPath}{filename} -o dist{relPathNoRoot}",
		"src/client/**/*.jade   : gulp createTemplateCache",
		"src/server/**/*.jade : copy {relPath}{filename} dist{relPathNoRoot}",
		"src/**/*.styl   : gulp compileStylus",
		"src/**/*-spec.coffee : mocha src{relPathNoRoot}{name}.coffee --compilers coffee:coffee-script/register",
		"src/**/*.coffee : gulp runSpec --file=src{relPathNoRoot}{name}-spec.coffee --require coffee-script/register --compilers coffee:coffee-script/register"
	]
}
```
You can create multiple save-commands.json files in various folders. The package will navigate file system tree
(starting with the folder where saved file is located) until it finds a config file. That folder will also
be used as current working directory for commands

If you get errors when saving a file, double check your save-commands.json file to make sure it is formatted properly. The package will warn you if the config file is malformed.

### Available parameters:  
- absPath: absolute path of the saved file (without file name)  
- relPath: relative path of the saved file (without file name)  
- relFullPath: like relPath but with filename
- relPathNoRoot: relative path without top folder  
- filename: file name and extension  
- name: file name without extension  
- ext: file extension  
- sep: os specific path separator
